## 💡 **Program Philosophy**

This program is built on four core principles:

### 1. **Hands-On First**
Theory without practice is quickly forgotten. 60% of your time will be spent in labs, actually configuring and testing features. You'll make mistakes, troubleshoot problems, and gain real muscle memory.

### 2. **Just-In-Time Learning**
Information is presented exactly when you need it. You won't learn about PIM on Day 1 when you're still figuring out users and groups. Each concept builds naturally on previous knowledge.

### 3. **Production Mindset**
Everything you configure follows production best practices. No shortcuts or "this is just for testing" approaches. By the end, your test environment will look like a real enterprise deployment.

### 4. **Continuous Relevance**
The program focuses on concepts and patterns, not just button-clicking. When Microsoft updates the UI (which they do frequently), you'll understand the underlying principles to adapt quickly.
